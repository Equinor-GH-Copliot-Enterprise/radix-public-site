# The Radix clusters

Your applications will run in a *Radix cluster*. We currently have two: **Radix Platform** and **Radix Playground**. Use Playground for testing Radix and see if it's a good fit for your needs. When your project and team are happy with Radix, you can register your application in the Platform cluster, which provides [specific guarantees](../../docs/topic-uptime/).

**Radix Platform** and **Radix Playground** clusters are hosted on Azure North Europe region.
