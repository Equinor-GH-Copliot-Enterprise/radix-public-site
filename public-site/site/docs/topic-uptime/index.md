# Uptime and availability

We are experimenting with an approach with "release channels" which differ in update frequency, service level agreement (SLA) and expected stability.

| Cluster        | Purpose                                     | Upgrade             |   Support   |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------- | :-----------------: | :---------: |
| **Production** | Products under development or in production |   Every ~6 months   |     Yes     |
| **Playground** | Testing and experimenting with Radix        |                     | Best-effort |

## Production cluster availability and services

The Radix Production cluster should be used when your team has chosen Radix as PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service) for a product under development or in production.

### Support

Schedule for Radix DevOps/Support team - 08:00 - 16:00 CET/CEST on Norwegian working days

- **Support channels:** File issue on [radix-platform repo](https://github.com/equinor/radix-platform/issues) or ask on [#omnia_radix_support](https://equinor.slack.com/messages/CBKM6N2JY) on Slack
- **Response time:** As soon as possible within business hours, at least next business day
- **On-call duty:** No, please contact us to discuss options
- **Resolution time:** Cannot be guaranteed, but for critical issues work on fixing the problem will start immediately and continue within business hours until resolved

### Uptime

- **Platform monthly uptime: 99.9%** - expected uptime for Radix as a hosting platform
  - Measured platform uptime last 3 months: 99,95%
- **Radix services monthly uptime: 99%** - expected uptime for Radix services, like CI/CD and monitoring
- **Planned maintenance:** We will announce planned maintenance at least 2 business days in advance. Downtime during planned maintenance does not affect uptime goals
- **Disaster Recovery:** Procedure is in place and the procedure is executed on a weekly basis. Estimated time to recover a cluster is 15 minutes, estimated time to rebuild and recover a complete cluster is 1 hour. 

### Associated operational risks

- No incident management beyond schedule "Norway - default" - i.e. no support after 16:00 CET/CEST on Norwegian working days
- Infrastructure downtime despite robust, high-availability infrastructure

### Uptime risk management

A risk assessment for cluster uptime has been done, and the most critical risk scenarios are identified, and risk mitigation actions have been agreed upon and are implemented as required.

## Radix Playground cluster services

Use Playground for testing Radix, see if itâ€™s a good fit for your projects, and provide feedback. When you are ready to commit, register your application in the Production cluster, which has improved stability.

- **Support channels:** Same as for Production cluster (see above). Help will be provided when team has capacity

- **Uptime:** "Best-effort", but no guarantee of uptime. Planned maintenance is announced as early as possible.

**Please note:** applications hosted in the Playground cluster may need to be re-registered after maintenance, upgrades or migrations. All such required actions from your part will be communicated in the Radix slack channel.
